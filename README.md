# labhub

Labhub is a web application that allows scientists to create proposals which can then be commented upon other users.  Once an admin approves the proposal, it then becomes an experiment and the proposer can now add collaborators, components, and comments. The purpose of this site was to allow scientists to communicate and connect with one another.

You can check out the live version [here] (https://labhub-2016.herokuapp.com/).
